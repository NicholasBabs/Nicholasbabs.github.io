This highlights the importance of e-commerce channels like Ajio and Amazon for driving sales.

The majority of orders come from customers aged 18-29, making this the key demographic.
Order volumes decline sharply for customers aged 40 and above, indicating a potential gap in appeal for older age groups.

Women account for a significant majority of sales, which highlights the need for marketing efforts focused on female customers.

"Set" and "Kurta" are the top-performing categories, generating the highest order quantities.
Products like "Western Dress" also perform well, while items like "Blouse" and "Bottom" lag behind.

The majority of orders are successfully delivered, indicating operational efficiency.
However, there are smaller shares of canceled and refunded orders that should be monitored to improve customer satisfaction.

Actionable Recommendations:

Strengthen marketing and distribution efforts in Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad.

Target Key Customer Demographics:

Create marketing campaigns and product offerings tailored to customers aged 18-29 and women.
